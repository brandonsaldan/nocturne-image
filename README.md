## How To Use

Unless receiving power through a Linux computer, running Nocturne on your Car Thing requires a host device such as a Raspberry Pi, a microSD card, a microUSB to USB-C cable, and a microUSB/your power source's connector. You will also need [superbird-tool](https://github.com/thinglabsoss/superbird-tool) to flash the image regardless of your computer's operating system.

**Note: The Debian image used to run this software on the Spotify Car Thing hardware currently does not support GPU acceleration. Some animations within the program may appear as laggy on-device, but we're working on a fix!**

### Windows

#### Raspberry Pi Setup

Download and open [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe), select Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit), select "Edit Settings", check "Set hostname", check "Set username and password" (set a password), check "Configure wireless LAN", (enter your network's SSID and password), check "Set local settings". Open the Services tab, enable SSH, and use password authentication. Write the configured OS to your microSD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.

#### Flashing Process

If you haven't already, download [superbird-tool](https://github.com/thinglabsoss/superbird-tool) and run the setup process detailed [here](https://github.com/thinglabsoss/superbird-tool?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-platforms).

Download and unzip the latest image from [Releases](https://github.com/brandonsaldan/nocturne-image/releases), connect Car Thing to your computer in USB Mode (hold preset buttons 1 and 4 while connecting), and run the following from your command line:

```bash
# Go into the superbird-tool repository
$ cd C:\path\to\superbird-tool-main

# Find device
$ python superbird_tool.py --find_device

# Flash Nocturne image, without resetting the data partition 
$ python superbird_tool.py --restore_device C:\path\to\Nocturne_v1.0_2024-10-09 --dont_reset
```

Connect your Raspberry Pi to your computer and run the following from your command line:

```bash
# Transfer setup_host_rpi.sh to Raspberry Pi
$ scp \path\to\nocturne-image\setup_host_rpi.sh pi@raspberrypi.local:/home/pi/

# SSH into Raspberry Pi
$ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

# Make setup_host_rpi.sh executable
$ chmod +x /home/pi/setup_host_rpi.sh

# Execute setup_host_rpi.sh
$ sudo ./setup_host_rpi.sh

# Reboot Raspberry Pi
$ reboot
```

Connect Car Thing to your Raspberry Pi, download and install [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/), open the app and create a new connection with the VNC Server Address of `raspberrypi.local` and the port `5900`. This should look like `raspberrypi.local:5900`. Input `superbird` as the password.

Right click the connection, navigate to `Properties`, then `Expert`, and set `Quality` to `High`, and ensure that `RelativePtr` is set to `False`.

### macOS

#### Raspberry Pi Setup

Download and open [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.dmg), select Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit), select "Edit Settings", check "Set hostname", check "Set username and password" (set a password), check "Configure wireless LAN", (enter your network's SSID and password), check "Set local settings". Open the Services tab, enable SSH, and use password authentication. Write the configured OS to your microSD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.

#### Flashing Process

If you haven't already, download [superbird-tool](https://github.com/thinglabsoss/superbird-tool) and run the setup process detailed [here](https://github.com/thinglabsoss/superbird-tool?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-platforms).

Download and unzip the latest image from [Releases](https://github.com/brandonsaldan/nocturne-image/releases), connect Car Thing to your computer in USB Mode (hold preset buttons 1 and 4 while connecting), and run the following from your command line:

```bash
# Go into the superbird-tool repository
$ cd /path/to/superbird-tool-main

# Find device
$ /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 superbird_tool.py --find_device

# Flash Nocturne image, without resetting the data partition 
$ /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 superbird_tool.py --restore_device /path/to/Nocturne_v1.0_2024-10-09 --dont_reset
```

Connect your Raspberry Pi to your computer and run the following from your command line:

```bash
# Transfer setup_host_rpi.sh to Raspberry Pi
$ scp /path/to/nocturne-image/setup_host_rpi.sh pi@raspberrypi.local:/home/pi/

# SSH into Raspberry Pi
$ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

# Make setup_host_rpi.sh executable
$ chmod +x /home/pi/setup_host_rpi.sh

# Execute setup_host_rpi.sh
$ sudo ./setup_host_rpi.sh

# Reboot Raspberry Pi
$ reboot
```

Connect Car Thing to your Raspberry Pi, download and install [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/), open the app and create a new connection with the VNC Server Address of `raspberrypi.local` and the port `5900`. This should look like `raspberrypi.local:5900`. Input `superbird` as the password.

Right click the connection, navigate to `Properties`, then `Expert`, and set `Quality` to `High`, and ensure that `RelativePtr` is set to `False`.

### Linux

#### Flashing Process

If you haven't already, download [superbird-tool](https://github.com/thinglabsoss/superbird-tool) and run the setup process detailed [here](https://github.com/thinglabsoss/superbird-tool?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-platforms).

Download and unzip the latest image from [Releases](https://github.com/brandonsaldan/nocturne-image/releases), connect Car Thing to your computer in USB Mode (hold preset buttons 1 and 4 while connecting), and run the following from your command line:

```bash
# Go into the superbird-tool repository
$ cd /path/to/superbird-tool-main

# Find device
$ sudo python3 ./superbird_tool.py --find_device

# Flash Nocturne image, without resetting the data partition 
$ sudo python3 ./superbird_tool.py --restore_device /path/to/Nocturne_v1.0_2024-10-09 --dont_reset
```
After the flashing completes, unplug and replug your Car Thing into your computer to boot into Nocturne. 

```bash
# Go into the nocturne-image repository
$ cd /path/to/nocturne-image

```
At this point, there are two different scripts that you can use. The first one, `setup_host_apt.sh`, is used on Linux distros that utilize apt as it's package manager. The second one, `setup_host_pacman.sh`, is used on Linux distros that utilize Pacman as it's package manager. If you use Pacman, replace `setup_host_apt.sh` in the following commands with `setup_host_pacman.sh` to continue with setup.

``` bash
# Make setup_host_apt.sh executable
$ chmod +x setup_host_apt.sh

# Execute setup_host_apt.sh
$ sudo ./setup_host_apt.sh
```

Connect Car Thing to your computer, download and install [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/), and open the app. Find the IP Address of your device and create a new connection with the VNC Server Address with the port `5900`. This should look something like `raspberrypi.local:5900`. Input `superbird` as the password.

Right click the connection, navigate to `Properties`, then `Expert`, and set `Quality` to `High`, and ensure that `RelativePtr` is set to `False`.
